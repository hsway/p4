# Hank Sway - P4 - Run Simple

## Description
Run Simple is a run log, allowing runners to keep track of their activity. For each run entered, the app offers the option to specify which pair shoes you went running in, so that you can keep track of each pair of shoes' mileage and know when to replace them. I made my best efforts to design the app responsively, so that it will look good on both desktop and mobile p hone displays.

## Details for teaching team

Please make your own account to test. I implemented email verification, so you'll need to verify your account to log in/out.

I also noticed that the delete confirmation popovers don't work on my iPhone.

I may also make a few commits after the due date, but I promise I'll restrict myself to styling changes. ;)
